 abstract = {ABSTRACT We describe the principle of integral field spectrographs employing fiber‐lenslet technology. By reference to instruments which we are constructing, we estimate the spatial and spectral resolution that can be obtained. We show that overlapping between light from adjacent elements at the slit, which is desirable in order to maximize the number of elements and hence the field size, has negligible effect on resolution. We describe different strategies for background subtraction, taking account of the special characteristics of this type of system and compensating for manufacturing defects. We also show how background subtraction may be done when an adaptive optics system is used to feed the integral field spectrograph. We show how these principles have been applied to a fiber‐lenslet design for the integral field unit of the GEMINI Multiobject Spectrographs and related instruments.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recognition that variation in the optical transmission of the atmosphere is probably the main limitation to the precision of ground‐based CCD measurements of celestial fluxes, we review the physical processes that attenuate the passage of light through Earth’s atmosphere. The next generation of astronomical surveys, such as PanSTARRS and LSST, will greatly benefit from dedicated apparatus to obtain atmospheric transmission data that can be associated with each survey image. We review and compare various approaches to this measurement problem, including photometry, spectroscopy, and LIDAR. In conjunction with careful measurements of instrumental throughput, atmospheric transmission measurements should allow next‐generation imaging surveys to produce photometry of unprecedented precision. Our primary concerns are the real‐time determination of aerosol scattering and absorption by water along the line of sight, both of which can vary over the course of a night’s observations.}
