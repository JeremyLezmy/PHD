 abstract = {ABSTRACT We describe the principle of integral field spectrographs employing fiber‐lenslet technology. By reference to instruments which we are constructing, we estimate the spatial and spectral resolution that can be obtained. We show that overlapping between light from adjacent elements at the slit, which is desirable in order to maximize the number of elements and hence the field size, has negligible effect on resolution. We describe different strategies for background subtraction, taking account of the special characteristics of this type of system and compensating for manufacturing defects. We also show how background subtraction may be done when an adaptive optics system is used to feed the integral field spectrograph. We show how these principles have been applied to a fiber‐lenslet design for the integral field unit of the GEMINI Multiobject Spectrographs and related instruments.},
